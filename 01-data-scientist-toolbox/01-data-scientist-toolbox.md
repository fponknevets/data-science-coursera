---

#### Descriptive Analysis

+ describe or summarize a set of data  

+ not for generalizing results of analysis for larger data populations  

---

#### Exploratory Analysis

+ examine or explore the data and find relationships that were not previously known  

+ helps formulate hypotheses  

+ correlation does not imply causation  

---

#### Inferential Analysis

+ use a small sample to say something about the population at large  

+ estimate for a variable in the population and provide certainty

+ accuracy of inference relies heavily on the sampling scheme

---

#### Predictive Analysis

+ use current data to make predictions about future data

+ accuracy depends on measuring the right variables

+ more data and a simpler model is better at predicting outcomes

+ correlation once again does not necessarily prove causation
