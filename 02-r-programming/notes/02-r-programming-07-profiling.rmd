## Profiling

### Using system.time()

Returns an object of the class ```proc_time```.

+ **user time** - time charged to the CPU for the expression
+ **elapsed time** - "wall clock time"

```R
> system.time(readLines("https://www.mit.edu"))
   user  system elapsed 
  0.026   0.006   0.366
> # elapsed time > user time due to waiting for the return of data over the network from readLines
>
> hilbert <- function(n) {
+ i <- 1:n
+ 1 / outer (i-1, i, "+")
+ }
> x <- hilbert(1000)
> system.time(svd(x))
   user  system elapsed 
  3.029   0.000   3.098 
> # in this elapsed time is supposed to be less than user time because svd shold make use of a multi threaded library on the Mac, but I am running on a Linux PC.

### Using Rprof() summaryRprof()

```Rprof()``` samples the function call stack every 0.02 seconds.

``` summaryRprof()``` summarises the data produced by the profiler. Summaries can either by
